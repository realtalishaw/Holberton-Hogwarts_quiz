Welcome to the Holberton School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

At Holberton, it's no secret that we're Wiz's with a keyboard, so it's only fitting that we are sorted into our proper houses! Now, we can't all go to Hogwarts and get sorted by the Sorting Hat itself, so I've built the next best thing! A program that sorts us!

This program uses bash scripting and basic C to sort you into either Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin. We're also assuming you know what the different houses in Hogwarts represent, however if you don't I've added a simple explanation to each!

To use the program, after cloning to your terminal, simply run the quiz_title.sh (./quiz_title.sh) from your command prompt! Be sure to post in the slack channel your house!Have fun!

I solemnly swear I am up to no good....  -Talisha â™¥
